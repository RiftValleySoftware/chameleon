Part of the BAOBAB Server, which is part of the Rift Valley Platform

INTRODUCTION
============
CHAMELEON is a "first-layer" extension of \ref BADGER.

While BADGER provides a low-level interface and abstraction to the databases, CHAMELEON starts to put these abtractions to work.

\ref BADGER is the "First Layer Connection" to the data storage subsystem. It uses [PHP PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) to abstract from the databases, and provide SQL-injection protection through the use of [PHP PDO Prepared Statements](http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepared-statements.php).

COLLECTIONS
-----------

CHAMELEON introduces the `CO_Collection` class (and some similar ones, all based on the `tCO_Collection` trait) that provide for a hierarchy. The collection classes can aggregate other instances (including other collections).

Because collections are implemented using [PHP traits](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.traits.php), they are more like a "mixin" class, than a straight hierarchy. Keep this in mind if you will be deriving from them.

OWNER
-----

The database has the concept of object "owners." These are IDs (numerical), assigned to the "owner" column in the data database rows. The "owner" is another row (of the ID referenced). The relationship is extremely simple, and is really meant as a "triage" for large datasets.

PLACES
------

CHAMELEON has a specialization of the `CO_LL_Location` class (`CO_Place`), where it adds address elements (and the ability to have Google Geocoding/Reverse Geocoding applied). It further extends that for the United States, with `CO_US_Place`.

KEY/VALUE PAIR STORAGE
----------------------

CHAMELEON introduces the KEY/VALUE (sometimes known as DICTIONARY) pattern for storing arbitrary data (the `CO_KeyValue` class). The data can be quite large, as its stored in the payload column. The key needs to be unique within the database, but the access_class of the row is also figured into the calculation, so you have a bit of flexibility.

IMPLEMENTATION
==============

You implement CHAMELEON by setting up a pair of databases, and reference them via the `CO_Config` static class, then instantiate `CO_Chameleon`.

EXTENDING CHAMELEON
===================

If you will extend a class, you should keep the base class name (after the `"CO_"`), because we can do a wildcard lookup to get hierarchies.

`CO_Place`, `CO_KeyValue` and `CO_Collection` / `CO_Place_Collection` / `CO_US_Place_Collection` are all designed to be extended, so a UK place might be `"CO_UK_Place"`.
